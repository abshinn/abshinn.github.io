## Similarity

This d3.js visualization was built with the purpose to help increase the supply of projects on [DonorsChoose.org](http://www.donorschoose.org) by recommending school districts that have the most potential to be active on DonorsChoose.org. District recommendations are based on the [cosine-similarity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity) between the recommended district and active DonorsChoose districts that have more than 3 projects per year. 

Code for the analysis is available on Github at [github.com/abshinn/mind-the-gap](http://github.com/abshinn/mind-the-gap). Code for the d3.js visualization is [available here](https://github.com/abshinn/abshinn.github.io/tree/master/projects/mind-the-gap).
