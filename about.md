This is a blog about data science, a place where I can share data science nuggets, useful computational tidits, and neato visualizations. I started out in planetary science and fell in love with all things data. I am a data scientist at [kWh Analytics](www.kwhanalytics.com), a solar energy startup in San Francisco.
